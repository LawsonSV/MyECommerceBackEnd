# MyECommerceBackEnd

## Description

This is an E-Commerce Back End Server that I created with the help of the starter code provided to me. I created this application by creating a series of models using sequelize, using belongsto/has relationships to connect those models together, and a series of post, get, put and delete routes to create, read, update and delete tables and columns on the localhost server. I then used schema to create the database that those tables would be placed into, ran the seeds index file to create and populate tables based on the models, and then ran the 3001 server port to access them.
